            <li>what's my educational and career experience ?</li>

        <p>
            I'm Yossi (Yossef Vashdi), born in Israel, Tel-Aviv, and live here happily.
            consider myself as an ordinary person, unique as much as everyone else on this planet,
            and without any particular trait that I would think worth mentioning.
            <br>
            The interest in coding started from the moment I got exposed to it (in intoduction course at the Technion)
            and learning more about it drows me. I feel privilaged for this opportunity.
            <br>
            at the moment I dont have much experiance.
            <br>
            I think that making coding a creer for be would be a good idea, since I always
            enjoy coding in addition to -learning- in general.

                I feel content with the mudane rutine, and therefore and no desire to travel anywhere,
                though I can appreciate the beauty of it, all the new places all the new countries and
                different culture and lifestyles.
                it's definitely apealing, but not to the degree of making change in my current life style,
                at least not for now, and not on it's own.
